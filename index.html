                  <p>Racial discrimination is widespread in the legal system of the United States.In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, discussions around police reforms have heightened and centered on how law enforcement engages with people of color.
                     The group analyzeed the data of racial bias existed in the legal systems, law enforcement engages with people of color in California, and recidivism scores. 
                     By drawing the conclusions from the data, it is clear racial disparities within the legal system continue to be a pressing issue for the nation.

                  <p>African Americans are disproportionately arrested</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     Looking at the percentage composition of arrests by race, it is clear that Black individuals 
                     are disproportionately arrested considering that they constitute only 13.6% of the population
                     while making up 27% of all arrests in the last 10 years.

                  <p>The role of the war on drugs</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     A major contributor towards this disproportionality is the role of law enforcement in drug-related
                     arrests and incarceration. As can be seen by filtering the percent composition of arrests to only
                     show marijuana related crimes, it can be seen that the inbalance increases. The war on drugs has
                     contributed to the disproportionate police enforcement on the African American community. This has
                     then led to inbalances and disadvantages for the African American communities in terms of family well-being,
                     stability, and employment. You can read more about this in the following

                  <h4>Recidivism Rates by Race (Prisoners Released 2008)</h4>
                  <p>Background on study</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     This data comes from a report from the Department of Justice which follows up on prisoners released
                     from prison in 2008 from 24 different states. The study was interested in recidivism specifically and
                     did not have a specific lens on race and ethnicity. They followed these ex-convicts for ten years following
                     their release and tracked their recidivism rates by year. You can read more
                     <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/BJS_PUB/rpr24s0810yfup0818/Web%20content/508%20compliant%20PDFs">here</a>.

                  <br>
                  <p>Analysis of data by race and ethnicity</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     The findings of interest that we have drawn from the study are those which pertain to race specifically,
                     so below you can see the recidivism rates in aggregate up to the year selected from the slider. In addition,
                     we drew specifically the data for all, white, and black prisoners in the study. The key finding that you can 
                     see here is that African Americans are year on year above the recidivism rates of all races in aggregate and the 
                     gap only widens when comparing Blacks to Whites specifically. This disproportionality which exists in terms of 
                     recidivism only further magnifies the disadvantages and imbalances which were mentioned above in terms of arrest 
                     and incarceration.

                     <p>In this section, we will discuss the racial biases introduced by technologies used in the U.S. legal systems.</p>
                  </div>

               <div class="col-md-12">
                  <p>With the rise of machine learning, the US court also have implemented the new technology. A computer program spat out a score predicting the likelihood of each committing a future crime. Borden — who is black — was rated a high risk. Prater — who is white — was rated a low risk. Two years later, we know the computer algorithm got it exactly backward. Borden has not been charged with any new crimes. Prater is serving an eight-year prison term for subsequently breaking into a warehouse and stealing thousands of dollars’ worth of electronics.</p>
                  <p>Scores like this — known as risk assessments — are increasingly common in courtrooms across the nation. They are used to inform decisions about who can be set free at every stage of the criminal justice system, from assigning bond amounts — as is the case in Fort Lauderdale — to even more fundamental decisions about defendants’ freedom. In Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, the results of such assessments are given to judges during criminal sentencing.</p>
                  <p>Rating a defendant’s risk of future crime is often done in conjunction with an evaluation of a defendant’s rehabilitation needs. The Justice Department’s National Institute of Corrections now encourages the use of such combined assessments at every stage of the criminal justice process. And a landmark sentencing reform bill currently pending in Congress would mandate the use of such assessments in federal prisons.</p>
                  <p>In 2014, then U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder warned that the risk scores might be injecting bias into the courts. He called for the U.S. Sentencing Commission to study their use. “Although these measures were crafted with the best of intentions, I am concerned that they inadvertently undermine our efforts to ensure individualized and equal justice,” he said, adding, “they may exacerbate unwarranted and unjust disparities that are already far too common in our criminal justice system and in our society.”</p>
                  <p>The sentencing commission did not, however, launch a study of risk scores. So ProPublica did, as part of a larger examination of the powerful, largely hidden effect of algorithms in American life.</p>
                  <p>We obtained the risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 and checked to see how many were charged with new crimes over the next two years, the same benchmark used by the creators of the algorithm.</p>
                  <p>The score proved remarkably unreliable in forecasting violent crime: Only 20 percent of the people predicted to commit violent crimes actually went on to do so.</p>
                  <p>When a full range of crimes were taken into account — including misdemeanors such as driving with an expired license — the algorithm was somewhat more accurate than a coin flip. Of those deemed likely to re-offend, 61 percent were arrested for any subsequent crimes within two years.</p>

                        As we discussed and visualized before, it is very clear that African Americans are
                        disproportionately affected by the current legal system due to human and systematic bias.
                        They are more likely to be arrested, incarcerated, and re-incarcerated. This is a problematic
                        cycle which has detrimental effects to the community as a whole.

                     <h3>If computers could accurately predict which defendants were likely to commit new crimes, the criminal justice system could be fairer and more selective about who is incarcerated and for how long. The trick, of course, is to make sure the computer gets it right. If it’s wrong in one direction, a dangerous criminal could go free. If it’s wrong in another direction, it could result in someone unfairly receiving a harsher sentence or waiting longer for parole than is appropriate.</h3>
                     <p>- The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants.</p>
                     <p>- White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.</p>
