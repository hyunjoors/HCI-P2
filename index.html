                     &emsp;Racial discrimination is widespread in the legal system of the United States. In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, discussions around police reforms have heightened and centered on how law enforcement engages with people of color. Our group analyzed the data of racial bias existing in the legal systems, law enforcement engagements with people of color in California, and recidivism scores. By drawing the conclusions from the data, it is clear racial disparities within the legal system continue to be a pressing issue for the nation.

                  <p>African Americans has been disproportionately arrested</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     Looking at the percentage composition of arrests by race, it is clear that Black individuals 
                     are disproportionately arrested considering that they constitute only 13.6% of the population
                     while making up 27% of all arrests in the last 10 years.

                  <p>The role of the war on drugs</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     A major contributor towards this disproportionality is the role of law enforcement in drug-related
                     arrests and incarceration. As can be seen by filtering the percent composition of arrests to only
                     show marijuana related crimes, it can be seen that the inbalance increases. The war on drugs has
                     contributed to the disproportionate police enforcement on the African American community. This has
                     then led to inbalances and disadvantages for the African American communities in terms of family well-being,
                     stability, and employment. You can read more about this in the following

                  <p>Background of the recidivism data</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     This data comes from a report from the Department of Justice which follows up on prisoners released
                     from prison in 2008 from 24 different states. The study was interested in recidivism specifically and
                     did not have a specific lens on race and ethnicity. They followed these ex-convicts for ten years following
                     their release and tracked their recidivism rates by year. You can read more
                     <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/BJS_PUB/rpr24s0810yfup0818/Web%20content/508%20compliant%20PDFs"><u>here</u></a>.

                  <p>Analysis of data by race and ethnicity</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     The interactive plot below uses the data with an aim to show race and ethnicity differences in the recidivism rates. The slider will allow you to aggregate up the recidivism rates to the year selected. In addition, we drew specifically the data for all, white, and black prisoners in the study. The key finding that you can see here is that African Americans are year on year above the recidivism rates of all races in aggregate and the gap only widens when comparing Blacks to Whites specifically. This disproportionality which exists in terms of recidivism only further magnifies the disadvantages and imbalances which were mentioned above in terms of arrest and incarceration.

                  <p class="lead">
                     When we compare shares each group represents in stops to shares by population, we find considerable disproportionality statewide. 
                     Black residents accounted for 16 percent of stops made by all participating law enforcement agencies during 2019 but constituted only 7 percent of the state’s population.
                     Residents identified by law enforcement as Middle Eastern or South Asian were also overrepresented in stops (5%) compared to their share of the state’s population (2%).
                     White residents were represented fairly proportionally in stops (33%), compared with their population share (34%), as were Latino residents (39% and 41%, respectively). 
                     Asian individuals were underrepresented in stops (6%) compared with their share of the population (12%), as were multiracial residents (1% and 3%, respectively).<br><br>

                     Individuals identified as Pacific Islanders were overrepresented (0.5% of stops, compared with 0.3% of the population), and those identified as Native American were underrepresented (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively). The percentage-point differences are small, but as a proportion of the population share, these differences are considerable. 
                     Again, the racial/ethnic identification comes solely from the officer making the stop.

                  <p class="lead">
                     While more than 90 percent of stops of individuals perceived to be Asian or of Middle East/South Asian origin are stopped for traffic violations, about 75 percent of Black Californians stopped 
                     are for traffic violations. Conversely, officers report reasonable suspicion in 21 percent of stops of Black people, while 11.7 percent of white people and 5.6 percent of Asian people are stopped for reasonable suspicion.
                     These racial inequities persist despite adjusting for context, providing empirical support for concerns historically voiced by communities of color.

                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p class="lead">
                     With the emergence of machine learning in many fields, the US court also has adopted this new technology with an aim to make better decisions in courts.
                     When judges make decisions in the court, there is a computer program that spits out a score predicting the likelihood of each committing a future crime -- <b>Recidivism</b>.
                     However, a recent study found that this new technology is not fair against African-American individuals [1].
                     <br><br>
                     Here is the real-world case that demonstrate such discrimination. The computer rated Borden — who is black — has a high risk of recidivism, while Prater — who is white — was rated a low risk. Interestingly, after two years, it was proven that the computer prediction was wrong, in fact reversly predicted. Borden (Black) was not charged again with any new crimes; Prater (White) was serving his eight-year prison sentence for subsequently trespassing and stealing properties.
                     <br><br>
                     The computer's such predictions are called risk assessments and widely used in courtrooms across the nation. These predictions are used in many stages of criminal justice system. Ex)<br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;- assigning bond amounts<br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;- deciding defendants’ freedom<br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;- sentencing appropriate punishment
                     <br><br>
                     In 2014, there was a voice concerned about the risk scores potentially injecting bias into the courts. The voice pointed out the unintended unjust disparities against certain group of individuals, which sparked the motivation of the study where we obtained the data.

                  <h3>Data</h3>
                  <p class="lead">
                     We used the data of 7,000 people who were arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014. The data contains the predicted recidivism score and whether or not the individual was charged with new crimes over the next two years.

                     In the court, judges are often presented with two sets of scores from the ML program -- Risk category (high, medium and low risk), and a corresponding decile score.
                     The following three visuals will explore the trend of predictions for each race/ethnicity group for each set of scores.

                  <p class="lead">
                     &emsp;The score proved remarkably unreliable in forecasting violent crime: Only 20 percent of the people predicted to commit violent crimes actually went on to do so.
                     <br><br>
                     &emsp;When a full range of crimes were taken into account — including misdemeanors such as driving with an expired license — the algorithm was somewhat more accurate than a coin flip. Of those deemed likely to re-offend, 61 percent were arrested for any subsequent crimes within two years.

                        As we discussed and visualized before, it is very clear that African Americans are
                        disproportionately affected by the current legal system due to human and systematic bias.
                        They are more likely to be arrested, incarcerated, and re-incarcerated. From the data of 4 million stops by California’s 15 largest law enforcement agencies in 2019, 
                        we could also see notable differences between African Americans and white Californians. 
                        This is a problematic cycle which has detrimental effects to the community as a whole.

                     <h3>With an aim to remove human and systematic bias in our legal systems, we have adopted ML algorithms in the legal decisions. However, our analysis shows that ML has increased/incurred greater race disparity in legal decisions</h3>

                     <h3>If computers could accurately predict which defendants were likely to commit new crimes, the criminal justice system could be fairer and more selective about who is incarcerated and for how long. The trick, of course, is to make sure the computer gets it right. If it’s wrong in one direction, a dangerous criminal could go free. If it’s wrong in another direction, it could result in someone unfairly receiving a harsher sentence or waiting longer for parole than is appropriate.</h3>
                     <p>- The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants.</p>
                     <p>- White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants.</p>
