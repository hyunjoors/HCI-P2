                     &emsp;Racial discrimination is widespread in the legal system of the United States. In the wake of the killing of George Floyd, discussions around police reforms have heightened and centered on how law enforcement engages with people of color. Our group analyzed the data of racial bias existing in the legal systems, law enforcement engagements with people of color in California, and recidivism scores. By drawing the conclusions from the data, it is clear racial disparities within the legal system continue to be a pressing issue for the nation.

                  <p>African Americans has been disproportionately arrested</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     Looking at the percentage composition of arrests by race, it is clear that Black individuals 
                     are disproportionately arrested considering that they constitute only 13.6% of the population
                     while making up 27% of all arrests in the last 10 years[3][4].

                  <p>The role of the war on drugs</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     A major contributor towards this disproportionality is the role of law enforcement in drug-related
                     arrests and incarceration. As can be seen by filtering the percent composition of arrests to only
                     show marijuana related crimes, it can be seen that the inbalance increases. The war on drugs has
                     contributed to the disproportionate police enforcement on the African American community. This has
                     then led to inbalances and disadvantages for the African American communities in terms of family well-being,
                     stability, and employment.[5] You can read more about this in the following

                  <p>Background of the recidivism data</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     This data comes from a report from the Department of Justice which follows up on prisoners released
                     from prison in 2008 from 24 different states. The study was interested in recidivism specifically and
                     did not have a specific lens on race and ethnicity. They followed these ex-convicts for ten years following
                     their release and tracked their recidivism rates by year. You can read more
                     <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/BJS_PUB/rpr24s0810yfup0818/Web%20content/508%20compliant%20PDFs"><u>here</u></a>.

                  <p>Analysis of data by race and ethnicity</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     The interactive plot below uses the data with an aim to show race and ethnicity differences in the recidivism rates. 
                     The slider will allow you to aggregate up the recidivism rates to the year selected. In addition, we drew specifically 
                     the data for all, white, and black prisoners in the study. The key finding that you can see here is that African Americans 
                     are year on year above the recidivism rates of all races in aggregate and the gap only widens when comparing Blacks to Whites 
                     specifically. This disproportionality which exists in terms of recidivism only further magnifies the disadvantages and imbalances 
                     which were mentioned above in terms of arrest and incarceration [6].

                  <p class="lead">
                     When we compare shares each group represents in stops to shares by population, we find considerable disproportionality statewide. 
                     Black residents accounted for 16 percent of stops made by all participating law enforcement agencies during 2019 but constituted only 7 percent of the state’s population.
                     Residents identified by law enforcement as Middle Eastern or South Asian were also overrepresented in stops (5%) compared to their share of the state’s population (2%).
                     White residents were represented fairly proportionally in stops (33%), compared with their population share (34%), as were Latino residents (39% and 41%, respectively). 
                     Asian individuals were underrepresented in stops (6%) compared with their share of the population (12%), as were multiracial residents (1% and 3%, respectively).
                     <br><br>
                     Individuals identified as Pacific Islanders were overrepresented (0.5% of stops, compared with 0.3% of the population), and those identified as Native American were underrepresented (0.2% and 0.3%, respectively). The percentage-point differences are small, but as a proportion of the population share, these differences are considerable. 
                     Again, the racial/ethnic identification comes solely from the officer making the stop.

                  <p>Analysis</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     While more than 90 percent of stops of individuals perceived to be Asian or of Middle East/South Asian origin are stopped for traffic violations, about 75 percent of Black Californians stopped 
                     are for traffic violations. Conversely, officers report reasonable suspicion in 21 percent of stops of Black people, while 11.7 percent of white people and 5.6 percent of Asian people are stopped for reasonable suspicion.
                     These racial inequities persist despite adjusting for context, providing empirical support for concerns historically voiced by communities of color.

                  <h3>Background</h3>
                  <p class="lead">
                     With the emergence of machine learning in many fields, the US court also has adopted this new technology with an aim to make better decisions in courts.
                     When judges make decisions in the court, there is a computer program that spits out a score predicting the likelihood of each committing a future crime -- <b>Recidivism</b>.
                     However, a recent study found that this new technology is not fair against African-American individuals [1].
                     <br><br>
                     Here is the real-world case that demonstrate such discrimination. The computer rated Borden — who is black — has a high risk of recidivism, while Prater — who is white — was rated a low risk. Interestingly, after two years, it was proven that the computer prediction was wrong, in fact reversly predicted. Borden (Black) was not charged again with any new crimes; Prater (White) was serving his eight-year prison sentence for subsequently trespassing and stealing properties.
                     <br><br>
                     The computer's such predictions are called risk assessments and widely used in courtrooms across the nation. These predictions are used in many stages of criminal justice system. Ex)<br>
                     &emsp;&emsp;- assigning bond amounts<br>

                     &emsp;&emsp;- sentencing appropriate punishment
                     <br><br>
                     In 2014, there was a voice concerned about the risk scores potentially injecting bias into the courts. The voice pointed out the unintended unjust disparities against certain group of individuals, which sparked the motivation of the study where we obtained the data.

                  <p class="lead">
                     We used the data of 7,000 people who were arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014. The data contains the predicted recidivism score and whether or not the individual was charged with new crimes over the next two years.

                     In the court, judges are often presented with two sets of scores from the ML program -- Risk category (high, medium and low risk), and a corresponding decile score.

                  <p class="lead">
                     Two pie plots provide an intrinsic comparison of risk categories between race groups.
                     In Race-Risk Category plot, we see that African-American and Caucasian groups are the majority of defendents in the data.
                     In Risk Category-Race plot, we notice that for those who predicted with 'low' risk of recidivism, there seems no significant difference between Black and White groups.
                     However, as we move up the risk category, it's always African-Americans who consist more than 60% of each category.
                     <br><br>
                     Now let us focus on African-American and Caucasian groups only for an easier comparison.
                     From the bar plot, we can clearly see a distinct pattern for each group. White individuals' decile scores are skewed toward lower deciles scores. Black individuals' scores are (somewhat) distributed over all scores, exaggerating the gap betwen the number of higher deciles scores between White and Black people.
                     <br><br>
                     The data hints us that there may be a racial disparity in the ML program that predicts individuals' future recidivism.
                     Now, lets look at those predictions' accuracy by comparing the score with the number of crimes that the defendants actually committed over the course of two years.

                     &emsp;- "Low" and "High" indicate the predicted decile category by the ML program

                  <p>Analysis</p>
                  <p class="lead">
                     We want to focus on True Negatives (Recidivated-Low) and False Positives (Survived-High).
                     For True Negative, there were 19% of White defendents and 14% of Black defendents. This may indicate that White people are predicted with low risk even though they reoffended in the future.
                     For False Positive, there were 14% of White defendants and 22% of Black defendants. We may interpret that Black people are more unfairly predicted than the other race with high risk even though they won't.

                     <h3>With an aim to remove human and systematic bias in our legal systems, we have adopted ML algorithms in the legal decisions. However, our analysis shows that ML has imposed a greater race disparity in the legal decisions.</h3>

                        Our analysis narrates a remarkably unreliable forecasting of crimes in the US courts.
                        It is very clear that African Americans are disproportionately affected by the current legal system due to human and systematic bias.
                        They are more likely to be arrested, incarcerated, and re-incarcerated.
                        From the data of 4 million stops by California’s 15 largest law enforcement agencies in 2019, we could also see notable differences between African Americans and White Californians. 
                        This is a problematic cycle which has detrimental effects to the community as a whole.

                        Thus, if our criminal justice system desires to be fairer and accurate in deciding who is incarcerated and for how long, we must continously audit the ML decisions to make sure information from the computer is righteous. If not, we are releasing dangerous criminals into the society while mistreat those who will truly rehabilitate.
